## Getting Started

#### Overview

As a part of the new AEROS Part A Subsystem, the new Batch Listing page has been given a technology refresh to update the look and feel of the current process, as well as provide the user with a more intuitive, efficient tools to navigate the Part A subsystem. The Batch Listing is separated into two sections - the search criteria and the results of the search in the Batch Listing table. When the Batch Listing is initially loaded, the search criteria will be set to the default settings, as shown in _Figure 1_. The search results set shown in the table will show batches in descending order with the most recently created batches at the top of the result set. Additionally, enhanced search features were addressed on the Batch Listing page to allow the user to quickly see only the batches they created and to preview the transactions in the batch without opening the batch.

#### Submit Batch

The user will be able to submit a batch to ELANY from the batch listing page. Please note that a batch can be submitted only if the batch status is in an ‘Open’, ‘Submit Failed’ or ‘Action Required’ status. As a result, the “Submit Batch” option will ONLY be available for batches that are in these statuses.

Alternate ways to submit a batch are from the Transaction Listing page and from the Transaction Details page.

To learn more about how to submit a batch from the Transaction Listing page, please refer to [Transaction Listing - Submit Batch](/guides/parta/transaction-listing#submit-batch).

To learn more about how to submit a batch from the Transaction Details page, please refer to the individual transaction links provided below.

- [Endorsement Transactions](/guides/parta/endorsement-transactions)
- [New Transactions](/guides/parta/new-transactions)
- [NOC Transactions](/guides/parta/noc-transactions)
- [Renewal Transactions](/guides/parta/renewal-transactions)
- [Stamp Only Transactions](/guides/parta/stamp-only-transactions)
- [Reverse CBOR Transactions](/guides/parta/reverse-cbor-transactions)
- [Suspense Resubmission Transactions](/guides/parta/suspense-transactions)

##### Procedure Summary

1. Click on the Kebab menu (3 vertical ellipses) located at the far end of the batch in the search results, as shown in _Figure 81_.

2. Select the 'Submit Batch' option from the pop-up menu, as shown in _Figure 82_.

3. Alternately, from the Batch Listing page, the user may also click on the batch number link of the batch they would like to submit, as shown in _Figure 83_. This will take the user to the batch details (or Transaction Listing page). For more details on how to submit a batch from the Transaction Listing page, please refer to this [link](/guides/parta/transaction-listing#submit-batch).

4. A Batch Submission prompt will be presented as an overlay on top of the Batch Listing page (from Step 2), as shown in _Figure 84_.

5. The Batch Submission prompt displays the Batch number, Item count, Total Premium, as shown in _Figure 85_ but these values cannot be edited by the user. This prompt also displays the Contact information for the batch (Batch Contact, Email Address, Phone Number, and Reference) and these values may be edited by the user.

6. To edit/change the batch contact information, start typing into these fields. Additionally, to clear the data entered in each of these fields, the user may click 'X' displayed at the end of these fields, as shown in _Figure 86_.

7. When any changes are detected to these fields, 2 additional icons appear on the screen - 'Save Changes' and 'Cancel Changes', as shown in _Figure 87_. Notice the fields that have been changed are identified as 'unsaved changes' in blue below them. Additionally, the 'CONTINUE' button is now disabled.

8. Click 'Save Changes' icon, as shown in _Figure 88_ to save the changes made to the batch contact information. Once the changes have been saved, a batch update success message, as shown in _Figure 89_ appears at the bottom right-hand side of the screen.

9. Click 'Cancel Changes' icon, as shown in _Figure 90_ to cancel the changes made and set the changed fields back to their previously saved values. Notice that when either Save or Change functions have been performed, both these icons disappear from the screen and the 'CONTINUE' button is enabled back.

10. Please note that editing the batch contact information on the batch submission prompt is optional.

11. Alternately, the user may choose to click on the 'X' button on the top right-hand corner of the prompt, as shown in _Figure 91_ to close the batch submission prompt and remain on the current page.

12. To submit the batch, click on the 'CONTINUE' button on the Batch Submission prompt, as shown in _Figure 92_.

13. The Batch Submission prompt shows the message that the items within the batch are being validated, as shown in _Figure 93_.

14. When error(s) are found within the transactions in the batch, a validation error message is displayed as shown in _Figure 94(a)_. Next, a validation error message listed by item(s) in the batch is displayed as shown in _Figure 94(b)_, clearly indicating which item(s) in the batch are in error and need to be corrected. The item(s) that have no errors are displayed with a green checkmark and those that have errors are displayed with a red exclamation point, as shown in _Figure 94(b)_. Notice that the 'CONTINUE' button is disabled.

15. To view the specific errors on an item in the batch, click on the 'Expand More' icon next to the item that is in error, as shown in _Figure 95_.

16. The prompt expands to show the specific errors associated with the item (or transaction) that failed the validation, as shown in _Figure 96_.

17. The user may directly go to the item (or transaction) in error by clicking on the item number link on the batch submission prompt, as shown in _Figure 97_.

18. This will take the user directly to the Transaction Details page of the corresponding transaction in error, as shown in _Figure 98_. To learn more details about handling data validation errors on transactions, please refer to this [link] (/guides/parta/validation-errors).

19. Notice that the transaction status is now ‘Submit Failed’, as shown in _Figure 99_. The Transaction Listing page now displays both batch status and transaction status of all transaction(s) within the batch as ‘Submit Failed’, as shown in Figure.

20. When no errors are found in the batch, a validation success message is displayed as shown in _Figure 100_.

21. When a batch contains transactions that require an Affiant on the ‘Affirmation’ section of the transaction, the user will be prompted to enter a pin code, as shown in _Figure 101(a)_. If multiple Affiant(s) are used on different transactions within the same batch, a pin code will be required for each Affiant (licensee or sublicensee) that affirmed a transaction within the batch being submitted. In this case, a corresponding pin code MUST be entered for each affiant that is displayed, as shown in _Figure 101(b)_.The user will have the option to click on the “eye” icon next to the ‘Pin Code’ field, as shown in _Figure 101(c)_, to view the pin code to make sure the pin code was entered correctly. The user may also click on the icon again to hide the pin code, as shown in _Figure 101(d)_.

22. After entering the pin code, click on the ‘CONTINUE’ button on the Batch Submission prompt, as shown in _Figure 102_, to submit the batch to ELANY. Notice that the ‘CONTINUE’ button is disabled until the Pin Code is entered, as shown in _Figure 101(d)_. However, if the user clicks on the ‘X’ button on the top right-hand corner of the Batch Submission prompt, BOTH the batch status and the transaction status of ALL transactions within the batch are set to ‘Submit Failed’. The user will be directed to the Batch Listing page.

23. However, if the user clicks on the ‘X’ button on the top right-hand corner of the Batch Submission prompt, BOTH the batch status and the transaction status of ALL transactions within the batch are set to ‘Submit Failed’. The user will be directed to the Batch Listing page.

24. A success message about the batch submission to ELANY appears, as shown in _Figure 103(a)_. An error message, as shown in _Figure 103(b)_ is displayed when an incorrect or expired pin code is entered by the user.

25. When the user clicks on the ‘DONE’ button or the ‘X’ button, as shown in _Figure 104(a)_ and _Figure 104(b)_, the user will be taken to a fresh Batch Listing page with the last entered search criteria, as shown in _Figure 104(c)_. The search results are not displayed until the user clicks the ‘SEARCH’ button.

26. When a batch ONLY contains transactions that DO NOT require an Affiant (like a Stamp Only and/or Endorsement transactions), then a Pin Code is NOT required by the system. In this case (example shows a Stamp Only transaction within a batch being submitted), a message appears that the items within the batch are being validated, as shown in _Figure 105(a)_. A validation success message is displayed if there are no errors, as shown in _Figure 105(b)_. This is followed by a success message about the batch submission to ELANY, as shown in _Figure 105(c)_.
