## Getting Started

<section markdown="1">

#### Overview

An application that provides new tools that will assist the Brokers to conduct searches for affidavits, declining companies, producing broker and life broker within the ELANY Electronic Filing System. These tools will utitlize various services to provide access into different components of the system and its data.

##### Purpose

Currently, in the Affidavit subpage users can search by Affidavit Number, Policy Number, Insured Name, or Batch Number. Users are limited to choose one of the search criteria and currently cannot search using multiple criteria. Results are displayed in a table beneath the search input and are sortable by Affidavit No, Policy No, Insured Name, Transaction Type, Inception Date, Expiration Date, Premium, Batch No, Date of Submission, and Processing State. Once a user receives a result set, the set cannot be further filtered and child and parent transactions are not connected in the result set.

This new subpage would improve search efficiency for EEFS users and provide the broker with a historical perspective on the activity that has occurred on an affidavit.
