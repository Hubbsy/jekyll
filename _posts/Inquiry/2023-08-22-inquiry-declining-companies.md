#### Declining Companies Table Features

##### Table Density

The user will be able to toggle the density of the table rows by clicking the **TOGGLE DENSITY** icon button located in the top right hand corner of the table, shown in Figure 4. By default the table rows are set to dense so toggling the density will make the table rows larger as shown in Figure 5. To reset the table density to default click the **TOGGLE DENSITY** icon button again.
